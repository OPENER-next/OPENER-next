The goal of the app is, with your help, to collect public transport barrier data and make it available on OpenStreetMap so that EVERYONE can benefit from it.

By asking simple questions about stops, citizens shall be put in a position to collect data in their vicinity in an accessible manner.

The data you collect will build the foundation for better travel information, especially for physically impaired people, and guide the upgrading process of bus stops.

Thank you for your contribution to a better local public transport.
